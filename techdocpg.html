          Introduction
        </header>
        <p><ul><li>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</li>
          <li>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;</li></ul>

          What Should You Already Know ?
        </header>
        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
<ul><li>
A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
<li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li></ul></p>

        <header>
          Javascript and Java
        </header>
        <p><ul><li>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</li></ul></p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
        <header>
          Hello World
        </header>
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");</code>
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>
          Variables
        </header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

<ul><li>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</li></ul>

<ul><li>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</ul></li>

<code>var x = 42.</code>
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
        <header>
          Declaring Variables
        </header>
        <p>
          You can declare a variable in three ways:
With the keyword var. For example,
var x = 42.
This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

By simply assigning it a value. For example,
x = 42.
This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.

With the keyword let. For example,
let y = 13.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Global_Variables">
        <header>
          Global Variables
        </header>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.

JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.

      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>
          Constants
        </header>
        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.

The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
<code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
<code>let y = 13.</code>
</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Type">
        <header>
          Data Type
        </header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

Six data types that are primitives:

Boolean. true and false.
null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
Number. 42 or 3.14159.
String. "Howdy"</p></section>
        <section class="main-section" id="If_Else_Statement">
        <header>
          If Else Statement
        </header>
        <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
          <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
statement_last; }</code>
